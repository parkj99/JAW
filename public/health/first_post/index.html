<p>I feel very healthy, and quite frankly, I haven&rsquo;t felt this healthy in a while. I&rsquo;m beginning to feel the consequences of my laziness and bad posture when I was a sedentary neet all throughout my life, and my lower back is definitely paying the price. I have been slowly working on my core, back, just generally stretching around my plevis and it has helped immensely to reduce the pain.</p>
<p>It never dawned on me that not all stretching is good. I loved stretching but I didn&rsquo;t realize the type of stretching I was doing was partially responsbiel for my backpain. I was stretching my hamstrings which actually contributed to my posterior pelvic tilt. I should&rsquo;ve been doing lunges to balance out my body. I wish somebody had taught me this and I didn&rsquo;t realize this myself through the ultmate life afflicting consequence. Oh well. Better that I realize now and work on it I suppose.</p>
