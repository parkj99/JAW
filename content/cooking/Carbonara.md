# Brief  
A classic dish. Easy to make theoretically but it's the mark of a chef who knows how to control the heat, making sure the egg sauce is creamy and the white doesn't set once it's mixed in.

# Cooking Instructions
1. Cut up the bacon into relatively big chunks.
2. Crack eggs into small bowl, grate cheese in, and whisk thoroughly  
Forgot to mention you should mince like 4-5 garlic cloves
3. Boil water for pasta - season with healthy dose of salt  
4. Follow pasta instructions on box exactly, (approx 8 mins for me) and start simmering the bacon so that it's well cooked once pasta is done.

(forgot to mentio
5. Once pasta finishes and bacon is nice and crispy, transfer pasta directly to bacon pan. If deemed too hot, take some pasta water and spritz to cool.
6. At this point heat should be completely off.
7. Slowly mix in egg yolk and vigoursly stir making sure egg mixture if creamy.

# Serving Instructions
I like to serve with a side of sweet Dill pickles. It gives a nice acidic tang to offset the heavy pasta and bacon.
