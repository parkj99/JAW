This is my first entry in my health journal. I think it will be neat to see the progression in my health and hopefully see the upward trend that it takes. I haven't decided on how often I will post, most likely once at the end of each month. Not to mention, I haven't decided what exactly I will post in this section.

I feel very healthy, and quite frankly, I haven't felt this healthy in a while. I'm beginning to feel the consequences of my laziness and bad posture when I was a sedentary neet all throughout my life, and my lower back is definitely paying the price. I have been slowly working on my core, back, just generally stretching around my plevis and it has helped immensely to reduce the pain. 

It never dawned on me that not all stretching is good. I loved stretching but I didn't realize the type of stretching I was doing was partially responsbiel for my backpain. I was stretching my hamstrings which actually contributed to my posterior pelvic tilt. I should've been doing lunges to balance out my body. I wish somebody had taught me this and I didn't have realize this myself through the ultmate life afflicting consequence. Oh well. Better that I realize now and work on it I suppose. 

My lowerback pain is persistent and uncomfortable. It is especially taxing during work which heavily affects my mood and ability to focus. I'm hoping for the future...
